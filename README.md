# Neural Network in C&#x23;

Forward feed neural network trained on the MNIST data set. The neural network has one hidden layer.
In the data folder, there are three weights files. "weights25.txt" represents the weights for a network of 25 hidden neurons, "weights50.txt"
represents the weights for a network of 25 hidden neurons, and "weights75.txt" represents the weights for a network of 75 neurons.
